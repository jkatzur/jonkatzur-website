#### Jon Katzur
I believe in the power of data.

In particular - I love figuring out how to empower people to better work with machines to do what they want. I enjoy the combination of product, math, software engineering, and design skills required. 

Throughout my career I've also had the chance to build and scale teams. I've created Solutions Engineering, Product, and Customer Success organizations, and built high performing Software Engineering teams.
